I grew up as an only child until the age of ten. 

After knocking on your friends door (this is how you met up with friends in the past, no texting back then kids), and finding out that no one was home I would retreat back to my house.
This would happen occasionally, and as a child I would find myself "bored". On such occasions I used to let my imagination run wild playing with lego, or draw computer game characters, such as sonic, lara croft etc.

I would use gaming magazines that I was lucky enough to have bought for me to use the images as reference. I used to enjoy drawing a lot, and I was pretty good for my age.

Sadly as I grew up I fell out of this habit, and indulged in the things young adults do, dating, drinking and generally making an arse out of myself. Over recent years I've felt the urge to draw more and more, but I've always told myself that I'm too busy with adult responsibilities, work, tidying up, drinking, and generally making an arse out of myself.

However recently I've been able to align "adult responsibilities", with the need to be better adapt to creating images as I've inherited responsibility of an in browser game at work. Having got into programming late on, age of 23, I didn't learn to code making clones of my favourite games as many of my colleagues did. Therefore I am relatively unskilled at creating games, even though I am a senior software developer.

In my quest to become component at making web games, I watched tutorials online, read blog posts etc. On this journey I found that quite a few of the developers actually called themselves developers/designers. Now I'm a full stack developer, I can make pages pretty, but I mainly focus on the back end systems, you know logic and stuff.

I was intrigued that being good at art was an invaluable skill for these developers as they could make a game end to end, without the need for an external designer. I liked this approach so much that after grabbing a sunday roast in town with 
my fianc√©e I decided to pop into water stones and see what they had.

Typical to my impulsive habits I walked out with 3 art technique books, a set of pencils and a sketch book, spending way more that I really needed to, oh well, yolo.

*list books

I obviously started with the fantasy art book first.

This was my first attempt, about an hour in. I admit that it took way longer than it should have to get to this point but in my defence the author states that getting the stance correct is vital, and I redid that about 20 times and I'm still not happy with it.

A major bug bear with this early image is the eyes, I haven't got the angle correct. I'll try to rectify this on the next iteration.

I'm hoping to crack on with these books and blog my pitiful progress, hopefully to the amusement of you the reader, but really I hope that I rekindle some of that inner child in you, maybe it's not drawing, maybe it's lego, or climbing or whatever.
