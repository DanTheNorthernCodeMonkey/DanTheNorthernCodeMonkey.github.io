Well I iterated on where I left off in the last post:

<a href="/img/drawing/starting/start-draw-03.jpg" alt="stage 1 drawings">
<img src="/img/drawing/starting/start-draw-03-small.jpg" />
</a>

And I royally screwed the eyes up. Luckily I percivered, and managed to get to a state wherby I was happy enough with the finished drawing:

<a href="/img/drawing/starting/start-draw-05.jpg" alt="stage 1 drawings">
<img src="/img/drawing/starting/start-draw-05-small.jpg"/>
</a>

The finishing touches really took the longest. There was a lot of rubbing out, and complete redraws of a few areas as well.
However I am quite happy with the highlighting. This was something I was never very good at as a youngster. This work is by no means good, but it's definitely a good start. 

I'm planning on buying a digital drawing tablet soon and I'll likely subscribe to photoshop. However as I'm on an ancient dell vostro 1720 running Ubuntu as I write this, I might opt to use inkscape which is an open source alternative.
