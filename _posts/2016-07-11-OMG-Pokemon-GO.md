I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was...

The theme tune descended upon me as I downloaded the APK filled with nostalgia and boyish glee. My office turned into raucous of hype, and mocking at the same time. Most of the people my age 26 where in, hook line and sinker as soon as the news that Pokemon Go had been released. To all those naysayers, exclaiming that it's for kids, we grew up on this shit:

I had adult things to this weekend, mainly consisting of driving, BBQing, drinking and then dying of a hangover. Today though was a day of searching far and wide. I had a cracking walk into work and running about at lunch catching them all. Much to the annoyance but also amusement of my Fianc√©e, as I would randomly stop, gormlessly raise my phone, do a flicking motion, then accelerate full pelt towards the next pokestop.

I even bailed as her colleague joined us walking into work because I'd spotted a pokemon off route, which left her having to make up some excuse for my ~~odd~~ justified behaviour.

It's fantastic when you see other people playing the game out in the real world as well, you get the sly smile of recognition that you are a part of this cool ~~sub~~-nerd-culture.

I even put my pokemon on a gym on the way home, only to have some upstart punk instantly knock it off. I had plans for revenge, to show them who they were messing with.

But then I remembered that I live in the ghetto and getting mugged while playing pokemon would probably hurt my street cred.

Also the amount of comedy gold coming out from this game is just beyond legit:

I think that's enough geeking out for now, I might write more about my adventures in Pokemon Go as it progresses, for now I'll leave you with this couple of images of the game and my progress:
