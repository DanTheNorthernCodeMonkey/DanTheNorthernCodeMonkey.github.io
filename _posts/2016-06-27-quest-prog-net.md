#Preamble

My quest began unexpectedly, deep within the QA of a ticket that was producing a dreaded deadlock.

Happy with myself that I'd slain the deadlock, I did the usual routine before moving onto more work, check slack, laugh at the ridiculous comments, gifs, hazing, then moved onto email.
Lurking within subject lines, which mostly can be summarised to "Panic, Fire, Fix, Not a real problem but drop everything and tend to my needs", I found that I'd been asked if I'd like to attend progressive .net.

I instantly responded with something along the lines of "I'm game for that.‚Äù in my usual quasi-professional style. Internally I was much more delighted, I'd never been to a paid for conference before, the team had gone to this one the year previous but I was not able to attend as I was swimming the channel in a relay team for charity.

Matt (a colleague) and I got booked into the conference at super late notice, and had to manically rush to find a decent deal for a hotel, most of which had sold out of twin rooms. We discussed broadening the search to include double rooms but sadly the prospect of spooning was not to be, as we lucked out and got a cracking deal on a twin room near kings cross, winning.

#Actual Quest

Progessive .Net was ran over 3 days, with a varying format for each day, but consistently had two talks on at once, meaning Matt and I had to split up for the majority of the blocks so that we could get the most out of the conference.

Talks I went to
Speaker, presenting style, knowledge, value of the talk, things I will take away.
